    Overview:

        Shader program 'sprite':
            Get shader desc: sprite_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_a_pos = 0
                    ATTR_vs_a_uv = 1
                    ATTR_vs_a_color = 2
                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: fs
                Image 'u_tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_u_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader sprite = sg_make_shader(sprite_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_a_pos] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_a_uv] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_a_color] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_u_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        vs_params_t vs_params = {
            .u_trans = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(vs_params));
